*When weapon skills miss outright, it deals 0 damage in the log instead of displaying "uses xyz but misses the monster."

*For Magical WSes, resistance and day bonuses are not included. Also, they are not counted as their correct element (e.g. wind WSes do not deal more damage on Earth Elementals)

*Status effects for weapon skills (e.g. Flat Blade stun) are not implemented.

*Mythic Weapon Skills are not displayed on the WS list.

*Some Relic Weaponskills are not displayed when the correct relic is equipped
 -DRK Apocalypse
 -DRG Gungnir

*Archery and Marksmanship WSes have not been included because of database inconsistencies and lack of necessary lua functions:
 - Incorrect animations post Dulling Arrow / Sniper Shot
 - Incorrect lua lookup, easily corrected in the sql db but needs to be universal (i'm looking at you devs).
 - LUA function needed >>>> attacker:getDistance(target)
 - LUA function needed >>>> attacker:getRangedDmg()
 - LUA function needed >>>> attacker:getAmmoDmg()

*Hand to hand WSes have not been included because of major problems with the hand to hand system:
 - Hand to hand does not hit with both hands, even as MNK main.
 - Weapon DMG is incorrectly calculated as 3 (bare fist) + h2h weapon. Should be:
    --Bare Fist = H2H Skill * 0.11 + 3
    --H2H Weapon = Added on top
